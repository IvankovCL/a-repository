"Words, Caravaggio. They have a power" (English Patient)
Your best ally has always been anger, but what you lack most is a heart. Even someone as burned and dead on the inside as me knows better then to underestimate the simple, yet undeniable power of..... human love. (c)
What was love, really? Flowers, chocolate and poetry? Or was it something else? Was it being able to finish someone`s jokes? Was it having absolute faith that someone was there at your back? Was it knowing someone so well that they instantly understood why you did the things you did - and shared those same beliefs? (c)
Знаешь, почему вы не поладили? Потому, что он мужская версия тебя. Вы как инь-инь, а ведь для гармонии нужно инь-янь. Инь-инь это ....кличка панды. (с)
